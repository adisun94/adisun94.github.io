  abstract={To understand the chloride (Cl)-induced initiation mechanism of localized corrosion of Aluminum (Al) alloys, we apply density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the interactions between Cl and hydroxylated α–Al2O3 surfaces, mainly (0001) orientation, under aqueous electrochemical conditions. Hydroxylated alumina surfaces thermodynamically stable in aqueous environments are constructed based on DFT calculations for both the single-crystal and bicrystal configurations. AIMD simulations suggest a Cl anion can only be stabilized on these surfaces by substituting a surface hydroxyl (OH) group. This substitution is thermodynamically favorable at sites on surface terminations of grain boundaries (GBs) in bicrystal configurations but not favorable at sites on single-crystal surfaces. Electronic structure analyses show that the different adsorption behaviors originate from the higher sensitivity of the Al–OH bond strength to the local coordination than its counterpart of the Al–Cl bond. The adsorbed Cl significantly increases the thermodynamic driving force for Al cation dissolution from alumina surfaces into the aqueous electrolyte, which can initiate localized corrosion.}

  abstract={The formation energies of native point defects in crystalline α-Al2O3 were investigated by combining first principles-based methods and theoretical models in a grand canonical framework. For defect formation reactions in this framework, the chemical potentials of chemical species and electrons can be constrained by the conditions of aqueous electrochemical systems, where liquid water is thermodynamically stable. Activation relaxation technique (ART) simulations using an empirical interatomic potential were implemented to discover candidates for stable configurations of point defects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were then used to confirm the accurate energetics of the candidate defect configurations. The results show that, except Al vacancies, the most stable defect configurations are generated by simply adding/removing atoms at particular high-symmetry sites. We also investigated the stability of these point defects as a function of the chemical potentials of both electron and oxygen. The results reveal that, at the conditions of thermodynamic stability for liquid water in aqueous electrochemical systems, Al vacancies as the most stable point defects in α-Al2O3 can be generated in exothermic defect formation reactions with negative formation energies. These thermodynamic tendencies provide critical insights into the nature of passive films formed under aqueous electrochemical conditions, particularly explaining of the formation of amorphous structures of passive alumina.}

  abstract={MoTe2 is the least explored material in the Molybdenum-chalcogen family. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) provides a unique opportunity to tackle the small electronegativity difference between Mo and Te while growing layer by layer away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that for a few-layer MoTe2 grown at a moderate rate of ∼6 min per monolayer, a narrow window in temperature (above Te cell temperature) and Te:Mo ratio exists, where we can obtain pure phase 2H-MoTe2. This is confirmed using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). For growth on CaF2, Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) reveals a grain size of ∼90 Å and presence of twinned grains. In this work, we hypothesis the presence of excess Te incorporation in MBE grown few layer 2H-MoTe2. For film on CaF2, it is based on >2 Te:Mo stoichiometry using XPS as well as ‘a’ and ‘c’ lattice spacing greater than bulk 2H-MoTe2. On GaAs, its based on observations of Te crystallite formation on film surface, 2 × 2 superstructure observed in RHEED and low energy electron diffraction, larger than bulk c-lattice spacing as well as the lack of electrical conductivity modulation by field effect. Finally, thermal stability and air sensitivity of MBE 2H-MoTe2 is investigated by temperature dependent XRD and XPS, respectively.}

  abstract={GaN PolarMOS is a vertical power transistor incorporating the unique polarization-induced bulk doping scheme in III-nitrides for the body p-n junction. We report the realization of this device, wherein the vertical channel, source contact, and body contact regions are successfully formed using three steps of selective-area epitaxial regrowth, all by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The fabricated PolarMOS has an excellent on-current of >500 mA mm−1 and a specific on-resistance of 0.66 mΩ centerdot cm2. The reverse breakdown mechanisms of the PolarMOS are investigated. First, a pronounced source-drain vertical leakage is identified and attributed to the passivation of the buried p-type body, which is subsequently resolved by the sidewall activation method. With the body leakage eliminated, the breakdown voltage is found to be limited by a highly conductive path along the regrowth sidewall interface using the conductive scanning probe technique, despite the absence of apparent structural defects.}

  abstract={We have examined the formation mechanisms of GaN quantum dots (QDs) via annealing of Ga droplets in a nitrogen flux. We consider the temperature- and substrate-dependence of the size distributions of droplets and QDs, as well as the relative roles of Ga/N diffusivity and GaN nucleation rates on QD formation. We report on two competing mechanisms mediated by Ga surface diffusion, namely, QD formation at or away from pre-existing Ga droplets. We discuss the relative roles of nucleation- and coarsening-dominant growth, as well as zincblende vs wurtzite polytype selection, on various substrates. These insights provide an opportunity for tailoring QD size distributions and polytype selection for a wide range of III-N semiconductor QDs.}

  abstract={Body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory multicomponent alloys are of great interest due to their remarkable strength at high temperatures. Optimizing the chemical compositions of these alloys to achieve a combination of high strength and room-temperature ductility remains challenging. Systematic predictions of these correlated properties across a vast compositional space would speed the alloy discover process. In the present work, we performed first-principles calculations with the special quasi-random structure (SQS) method to predict the unstable stacking fault energy () of the  slip system and the -plane surface energy () for 106 individual binary, ternary and quaternary bcc solid-solution alloys with constituent elements among Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re and Ru. Moreover, with the first-principles data and a set of physics-informed descriptors, we developed surrogate models based on statistical regression to accurately and efficiently predict  and  for refractory multicomponent alloys in the 10-element compositional space. Building upon binary and ternary data, the surrogate models show outstanding predictive capability in the high-order multicomponent systems. The ratio between  and  can be used to populate a model of intrinsic ductility based on the Rice model of crack-tip deformation. Therefore, using the surrogate models, we performed a systematic screening of ,  and their ratio over 112,378 alloy compositions to search for alloy candidates that may have enhanced strength-ductility synergies. Search results were also validated by additional first-principles calculations.}
