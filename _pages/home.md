## Welcome to my website!

I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year doctoral student in Materials Science and Engineering, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA. My current research interests are investigating the operational stability of structural materials used in various applications. To achieve this, I implement classical & quantum atomistic scale simulations (such as density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics, potential energy landscape methods) coupled with larger monte carlo and computational thermodynamics simulations to compute time dependent material properties.  Through academic projects and internships, I have gained familiarity with metallic and insulating materials that are used in 1) automobile components, 2) high temperature heat exchangers and 3) compact nuclear reactor moderators. Particularly, my research projects have focussed on exploring  thermodynamic stability, surface reactivity and defect transfer properties of insulating oxides, semi-metallic refractory hydrides and refractory metal alloys.

My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimentional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
