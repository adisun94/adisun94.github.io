## Welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Molecular Materials Group at Argonne National Laboratory. My research background is in the development of data pipelines for the discovery of advanced materials in energy applications. I am experienced in the building pipelines covering 1) data curation/generation using HPC sytems, APIs and web crawling techniques, 2) data cleaning & feature engineering using open-source python packages, 3) machine learning model development and validation (ensemble regression, neural networks) for accelerated high-throughput materials discovery and 4) creating interactive apps/dashboards for data visualization. During my doctoral and post-doctoral research, I have worked in several emerging energy technologies including solid-state batteries, hyrogen energy etc.

My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimentional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
