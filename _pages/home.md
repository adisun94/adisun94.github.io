## Welcome to my website!

I am a Computational Materials Scientist at Leidos Inc., working with the National Energy Technology Laboratory. My research background is in the integration of machine learning with multiscale simulation for accelerated materials discovery. My diverse research portfolio includes batteries, alloys, semiconductors, hydrogen, and molecules. <br><br>



My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical, and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimensional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
