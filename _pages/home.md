## Welcome to my website!

I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year doctoral student in Materials Science and Engineering, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA. My current research interests are investigating the operational stability of structural materials used in various applications. To achieve this, I implement classical & quantum atomistic scale simulations (such as density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics, potential energy landscape methods, computational thermodynamics) coupled with data driven techniques such as multivariable regression and machine learned force fields. Through academic projects and internships, I have worked on projects applied to ionic conduction, calalysis, semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces and alloy design. Particularly, my research projects have focussed on exploring  thermodynamic stability, surface reactivity, defect mobility and potential energy landscape of insulating oxides, semi-metallic refractory hydrides and refractory metal alloys.

My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimentional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
