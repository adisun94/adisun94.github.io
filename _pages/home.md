## Welcome to my website!

I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year doctoral student in Materials Science and Engineering, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA. My current research interests are investigating the atomic and electronic scale origins of surface passivation in crystalline and glassy oxides (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>), by implementing first principles and classial simulations. I also develop and implement thermokinetic simulations based on computational thermodynamic, to investigate high temperature gas corrosion in heat exchanger materials (Fe and Ni alloys).

My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimentional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
