## Welcome to my website!

I am a final year doctoral student in Materials Science and Engineering, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA. My research interests and experience are in investigating the performance in reactive environments using multiscale modeling methods. I have reserached materials used in various applications, including  battery materials & interfaces, ionic conduction, calalysis, hydrogen storage and alloy design.

My previous research experience includes experimental analysis of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of epitaxial 2-dimentional films, such as MoSe<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Particularly, I have employed diffraction and spectroscopic methods to investigate their atomic structure.
